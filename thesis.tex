% This template is designed to operate with XeLaTeX.
%
% All elements in the Title, Abstract, and Keywords MUST be formatted as text and NOT as math.
%
%Further instructions for using this template are embedded in the document. Additionally, there are comments at the end of the file that give suggestions on writing your thesis.  
%
%In addition to the standard formatting options, the following options are defined for the VTthesis class: proposal, prelim, doublespace, draft. 

\documentclass[doublespace,draft,nopageskip]{VTthesis} % nopageskip - Removes arbitrary blank pages.

% Using the following header instead will create a draft copy of your thesis
%\documentclass[doublespace,draft]{VTthesis}

% The lipsum package is just included to put dummy text in the document in order to demonstrate page headers and table of contents behavior. You should remove it once you begin writing your actual thesis or dissertation.

\abstract{In recent years, neuro-symbolic learning methods have demonstrated promise in tasks requiring a semantic understanding that can often be missed by traditional deep learning techniques. By integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning architectures the interpretability of the model's reasoning becomes more evident and can provide more control during deployment. This thesis aims to apply neuro-symbolic learning to the domain of reinforcement learning. First, a simulation environment for robotic manipulation tasks based on the Gazebo physics simulator and ROS2 middleware suite is presented. In this environment an analysis of policy-gradient based reinforcement learning algorithm is given. Then, by leveraging the performance of deep learning with the semantic reasoning and interpretability of symbolically defined programming, a novel neuro-symbolic learning method is proposed to generalize tasks and motion planning for robotics applications using natural language. The novel neuro-symbolic can be seen as an adaptation of the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (Mao et. al) developed by IBM Watson, in which images and natural language are first processed by convolutional and residual neural networks, respectively and then parsed by a symbolically reasoned program. Where the architecture proposed in this paper differs, is in its use of the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner for preprocessing of a given input task, to then inform a reinforcement learning agent of how to act in a given environment. Finally, the novel adaptation of the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner is introduced as a method of controlling multi-task agents.

%****************************************************************************
% Below are some general suggestions for writing your dissertation:
%
% 1. Label everything with a meaningful prefix so that you
%    can refer back to sections, tables, figures, equations, etc.
%    Usage \label{<prefix>:<label_name>} where some suggested
%    prefixes are:
%			ch: Chapter
%     		se: Section
%     		ss: Subsection
%     		sss: Sub-subsection
%			app: Appendix
%     		ase: Appendix section
%     		tab: Tables
%     		fig: Figures
%     		sfig: Sub-figures
%     		eq: Equations
%
% 2. The VTthesis class provides for natbib citations. You should upload
%	 one or more *.bib bibtex files. Suppose you have two bib files: some_refs.bib and 
%    other_refs.bib.  Then your bibliography line to include them
%    will be:
%      \bibliography{some_refs, other_refs}
%    where multiple files are separated by commas. In the body of 
%    your work, you can cite your references using natbib citations.
%    Examples:
%      Citation                     Output
%      -------------------------------------------------------
%      \cite{doe_title_2016}        [18]
%      \citet{doe_title_2016}       Doe et al. [18]
%      \citet*{doe_title_2016}      Doe, Jones, and Smith [18]
%
%    For a complete list of options, see
%      https://www.ctan.org/pkg/natbib?lang=en
%
% 3. Here is a sample table. Notice that the caption is centered at the top. Also
%    notice that we use booktabs formatting. You should not use vertical lines
%    in your tables.
